## About Dart

[Dart](https://dart.dev/) is an open-source, general-purpose programming language developed by Google. Dart is used to build web, server, desktop, and mobile applications. It powers the **Flutter framework**, enabling developers to create beautiful, natively compiled applications for multiple platforms from a single codebase.

## Why Learn Dart?

- **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy anywhere using Flutter.  
- **Optimized for UI**: Build apps with smooth UIs and animations.  
- **Highly Performant**: Dart compiles to native code and JavaScript.  
- **Easy to Learn**: Familiar syntax for JavaScript, C#, or Java developers.  
- **Active Community**: Supported by Google with a growing community.
