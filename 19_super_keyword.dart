///The super keyword in Dart is used to access properties, methods, or constructors from a parent class (also known as a superclass).
///It is helpful when you want to reuse functionality from the parent class within a subclass (child class)
///Use the super keyword to access the parent classâ€™s version of a method or constructor, especially if the child class overrides that method.
///super works only in classes that have inheritance (using extends).
