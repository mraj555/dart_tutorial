///In Dart, mixins allow you to share code between multiple classes.
///They are like "building blocks" that you can mix into a class to give it additional functionality, without using inheritance.
///No Parent-Child Relationship: Unlike inheritance, you don't need to extend the mixinâ€™s class; you just mix it in.
///Use with: To apply a mixin to a class, use the with keyword.
///Use mixins when you want to reuse behavior across multiple, unrelated classes without using inheritance.
